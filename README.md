# HexAround

HexAround is a strategy game developed for Object Oriented Analysis and Design (CS 4233). This project was developed using Java and the Builder Design pattern. The game uses a hexagon board and an [Axial coordinate system](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redblobgames.com%2Fgrids%2Fhexagons%2F%23coordinates&sa=D).

The original documentation is in [Hexaround.pdf](https://github.com/MurkingtonWizard/HexAround/blob/main/Hexaround.pdf).

My work for the project is contained in [src/hexaround/game](https://github.com/MurkingtonWizard/HexAround/tree/main/src/hexaround/game) and my JUnit tests are in [test/game](https://github.com/MurkingtonWizard/HexAround/tree/main/test/game).
